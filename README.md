# Tentaclimb
A couch co-op game where you work together to climb out of the ocean. Try it out for free!

**NOTE: Tentaclimb currently only supports gamepad controls. Mouse and keyboard controls will be added in the future**

Tentaclimb is in a very early state. I am developing it in my free time so expect updates to be slow. Feedback is appreciated!
