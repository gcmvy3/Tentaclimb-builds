Tentaclimb is a couch co-op game where you work together to climb out of the ocean. Try it out for free!

**NOTE: Tentaclimb currently only supports gamepad controls. Mouse and keyboard controls will be added in the future**

[Latest Mac OS Build](https://github.com/gcmvy3/Tentaclimb-builds/raw/main/Builds/Tentaclimb%20Pre-alpha%20(Mac%20OS).app.zip)

Tentaclimb is in a very early state. I am developing it in my free time so expect updates to be slow. Feedback is appreciated!
